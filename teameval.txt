               Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #3

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.
If you worked alone leave column B blank

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Xinyu Xie, A53285829

 
B: Gehua Qin, A53283886

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 	  	  	6               6
coding 	  	  	        15             10
writeup 	  	  	8               5
planning (alone) 	  	4            4    	 
total (including meetings) 	33      25         	  	 


(3) Discuss the following.
(a) If you worked in a team, what were the major responsibilities
    of each team member?
    We almost share every part of the work. Generally, we take turns to implement an idea and debug for each other.
(b) Did you complete the assignment?
    Yes!
(c) What were your major strengths and weaknesses in doing this
    assignment (individually or in a team)?
    If in a team, also discuss how your team worked together.
    In a team. Our team divided the project into several parts, and allocated these parts to each one so that the process would go fast.
(d) What  lessons did you learn from these events.
    Start early does benefit. Also before coding, write a complete pseudocode can help a lot.
(e) If in a team, whether and how you plan to change the way
    your work together .
    We like the way we work together.
(f) Anything else that comes to mind.
    Computation resource is so valuable that no one should waste too much.
